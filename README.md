## Discord Bot Development

This is a Discord Bot that will, in the future, do everything you need (hopefully).
This project was developed using JavaScript and Discord JS framework, with the help of this YouTube playlist: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j_sD9udZnCk&list=PLbbLC0BLaGjpyzN1rg-gK4dUqbn8eJQq4.

# How to set the bot?
- Go to https://discord.com/developers and make an application. After creating your application, you should have the option to create a bot user.
- Make a folder for which your bot's coding will be in
- Do "shift" + "right click" and select open powershell (or cmd depending on your PC)
- Type `npm init` to initiate
- Type `npm install discord.js`, we are installing the discord.js module. Note: This will make a file called `package-lock.json` and a directory called `node_modules`, please don't delete that.
- Get your bots token. Reminder, bot tokens are key information that gives complete access to your bot.
- Place your bot's token **between** the quotation marks, you can also edit the prefix if you'd like.
- Run your bot by typing `node bot` into your powershell/cmd
- Use this link and replace **client_id_here** with your actual client ID
https://discordapp.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=client_id_here&permissions=0&scope=bot

# And your bot is running!
Enjoy the bot, updates are frequent so always return to replace your `bot.js` with the newest one.
